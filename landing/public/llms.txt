# Verifik x402 — The Trust Layer for AI Agents

> Verifik is a trust layer that verifies the humans and companies behind autonomous AI agents using 100+ official government database integrations across 20+ countries, powered by x402 payments on Avalanche.

## Overview

Verifik provides government-grade identity verification as a service. AI agents and developers can verify people, companies, vehicles, criminal records, and sanctions lists in real-time. Payments are handled via the x402 protocol (HTTP 402 Payment Required) on the Avalanche C-Chain, enabling pay-per-verification with AVAX — no API keys or credit cards needed.

### Mission

Build the compliance and identity layer the autonomous agent economy needs. Every AI agent should have a verifiable on-chain identity linked to a real human or company.

### Key Stats

- 23M+ identities verified
- 45 enterprise clients
- 14+ official government database sources
- 100+ verification endpoints
- 20+ countries covered
- <1s average response time
- $0.02 average verification cost via x402
- Live on Avalanche C-Chain (Mainnet)

## Products

### smartCHECK
Real-time identity and data verification via API. Validate people, companies, vehicles, voting records, health registries, lawyers, drivers, and more across 20+ countries in the Americas and beyond.

### smartBATCH
Bulk verification processing. Upload CSV or Excel files with millions of records. Our system processes them in parallel, enriching and validating each row against official government databases.

### smartENROLL
KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) onboarding. Combines document verification, biometric validation (face recognition + liveness detection), and data validation against government registries.

### smartACCESS
Passwordless authentication and login. OTP-based verification via SMS, WhatsApp, or email for frictionless user access.

## x402 Payment Protocol

x402 enables pay-per-request API access using cryptocurrency. Instead of API keys and credit systems, agents pay per verification on-chain.

### How It Works

1. Agent sends a verification request to the Verifik gateway
2. Gateway responds with HTTP 402 Payment Required, including price and payment address
3. Agent sends AVAX payment to the VerifikPayment smart contract
4. Agent resubmits the request with the transaction hash in the `x-payment-tx` header
5. Gateway validates the payment on-chain (recipient, amount, replay protection)
6. Verified data is returned to the agent

### Payment Details

- Currency: AVAX (native) or VKA token (ERC-20, 1:1 USD equivalent)
- Network: Avalanche C-Chain (Chain ID: 43114)
- Average cost: ~0.02 AVAX per verification
- Finality: <1 second

## ERC-8004 Agent Standard

On-chain identity, reputation, and validation registries for autonomous agents. Three smart contracts deployed on Avalanche Mainnet:

### Identity Registry (ERC-721)
Each agent receives a unique NFT representing its on-chain identity, with metadata including name, capabilities, and Agent Card URI.
- Contract: `0xbcab451d6FEdc98f486E12e479287E3B67cbF9A1`

### Reputation Registry
On-chain feedback and ratings system. Ratings (1-5 scale) are linked to payment proofs, preventing fake reviews.
- Contract: `0x310247955605c357628F51e94b3E5A20225C71a4`

### Validation Registry
Stores validation proofs for completed tasks. Supports multiple validation types (re-execution, ZK proofs, consensus, oracle).
- Contract: `0xAfCb9b9bEAe7395Af6920bbA597d9602995660c5`

### Payment Contract
Accepts AVAX payments for x402 verification requests.
- Contract: `0x5e3C7c44e5d76fa5517378582B824046cBDcFfCD`

Permissioned tokens for the agentic economy. Integration with the T-REX standard (ERC-3643) will enable:

- Only verified agents can hold, transfer, or interact with regulated digital assets
- Compliance checks triggered automatically on token transfers
- On-chain KYC/AML verification as a prerequisite for token operations
- Sovereign identity layer for regulated DeFi
